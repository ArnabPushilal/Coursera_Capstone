# Coursera_Capstone

This was the capstone project for the IBM professional Data Science certificate. We had to use Foursquare API and Folium to do some clustering on a small dataset. I tried to leverage the Zomato API along with the foursquare api data to cluster fried chicken spots around delhi. 
Note: Folium maps did not render on github, check out the reports to see them!
